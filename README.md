## 100 - Introduction

Movie-as-Code (MaC) is a play on Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) which in the computer science domain means:

"Infrastructure as code (IaC) is the process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools."

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code


So in case of Movie-as-Code (MaC):

***"Movie as Code (MaC) is the process of managing and provisioning movies through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools."***

- Willem van Heemstra
